This is a sandbox project that I'm using to integrate GitHub with other tooling. It started as part of a two-day training class on git, and has grown to now encompass other features like tags and releases, as well as third-party platforms like Travis, Waffle, and possibly others.

If you have any questions, you can contact me via GitHub, or on Twitter at @morphosis7.
