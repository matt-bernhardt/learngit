This is a sandbox project that I'm using to integrate GitHub with other tooling. It started as part of a two-day training class on git, and has grown to now encompass other features like tags and releases, as well as third-party platforms like [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/), [Waffle](https://waffle.io/), [CodeClimate](https://codeclimate.com), and possibly others.
